<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oxygen Scavengers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metallic Oxygen Scavengers</li><li>Non-metallic Oxygen Scavengers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oxygen scavengers market is divided into two main types: metallic and non-metallic oxygen scavengers. Metallic oxygen scavengers typically contain elements like iron or cobalt, which react with oxygen to reduce its presence, making them effective in packaging and preservation. Non-metallic oxygen scavengers, on the other hand, utilize organic compounds or polymers to absorb oxygen without involving metals. Both types play crucial roles in industries such as food packaging, pharmaceuticals, and beverages by extending shelf life and maintaining product quality.</p></p>
