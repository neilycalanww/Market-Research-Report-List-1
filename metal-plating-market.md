<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Plating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electroplating</li><li>Electroless Plating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metal plating market primarily comprises two types: electroplating and electroless plating. Electroplating involves applying a thin layer of metal onto a substrate using an electric current, which allows for precise control over thickness and finish. In contrast, electroless plating uses a chemical reduction process to deposit metal without electrical energy, offering uniform coating and ability to cover complex shapes. Both methods enhance corrosion resistance, aesthetics, and wear properties, making them essential in industries like automotive, electronics, and aerospace.</p></p>
